# 11_Knowledge Systems & Academia (Draft / In Progress)

‚ö†Ô∏è Draft. This file explores how CLS can improve research and disciplinary integrity.

---

## 1. Why It Matters
- Academic knowledge often assumes **universality of models**.  
- This leads to blind misapplication: applying methods outside their valid context.  
- CLS resists this by treating contexts (disciplines, institutions) as **units with boundaries**.

---

## 2. Example Applications
- **Disciplinary mapping**: physics ‚Üî anthropology, keeping rules intact.  
- **Interdisciplinary projects**: build bridges, not forced unifications.  
- **Research integrity**: prevents epistemic contamination when models are imported uncritically.

---

üìå **Summary**  
CLS can protect disciplines from collapse, enable safe interdisciplinary work, and prevent blind misapplication of models.
