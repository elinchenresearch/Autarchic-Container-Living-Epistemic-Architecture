# 12_Technology & AI (Draft / In Progress)

‚ö†Ô∏è Draft. This file outlines how CLS applies to the design and evaluation of AI systems.

---

## 1. Why It Matters
- AI often assumes **one-context universality** (training data = global truth).  
- Risk: models flatten cultural reasoning or misapply knowledge.  
- CLS offers a method for **contextual integrity** in design and evaluation.

---

## 2. Example Applications
- **AI alignment**: sealing contexts prevents models from collapsing into one frame.  
- **Bias management**: mapping contexts reveals where model outputs silently collapse categories.  
- **Human‚ÄìAI collaboration**: CLS provides rules for parallel reasoning, not one-sided replacement.

---

üìå **Summary**  
CLS can strengthen AI by embedding context integrity, preventing blind universals, and enabling true collaborative reasoning.
