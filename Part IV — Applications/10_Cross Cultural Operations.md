# 10_Cross-Cultural Operations (Draft / In Progress)

⚠️ Draft. This file outlines how the Context Lattice System (CLS) applies to cross-cultural reasoning.

---

## 1. Why It Matters
- Cross-cultural spaces are **high-density contexts**.  
- Risk: one culture’s logic overwrites the other (universalism, dominance, or erasure).  
- CLS offers a method for **sealing, mapping, and bridging** without collapse.

---

## 2. Example Applications
- **Chinese ↔ Western epistemics**  
  - Direct mapping: conditional logic ↔ if–then logic.  
  - Declared non-equivalence: relational “self” ↔ individualist “self.”  
- **Academic collaborations** across cultural traditions.  
- **Diplomatic reasoning** where each side maintains integrity without dissolving into the other.

---

📌 **Summary**  
CLS provides a way to stabilize high-density cultural divides through sealing, mapping, and declared non-equivalence.
