# 13_Governance & Society (Draft / In Progress)

‚ö†Ô∏è Draft. This file explores how CLS applies to governance, institutions, and social systems.

---

## 1. Why It Matters
- Governance often fails by **forcing a single logic** across diverse contexts.  
- Risk: suppression, capture, or breakdown of legitimacy.  
- CLS offers a framework for holding difference **without collapse**.

---

## 2. Example Applications
- **Policy design**: treat social groups as distinct contexts, not reducible to one model.  
- **Institutional resilience**: sealing and bridging across sectors (law, science, culture).  
- **Conflict mediation**: declared non-equivalence prevents collapse into ‚Äúone side wins.‚Äù

---

üìå **Summary**  
CLS provides governance with a way to stabilize plural contexts, avoiding collapse into domination or fragmentation.
