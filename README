# Epistemic Autarchy: A Non‑Fused Human–AI Research System

## 🧠 Research Method: Non‑Fused Human–AI Cognition

This project is built on a **non‑fused collaboration** between a human structural thinker and large‑language models (LLMs).  
Rather than treating the AI as a passive assistant or generative tool, I use it as a *containment mirror*—an interface that reflects signals without imposing its own logic.  
This allows high‑density, structurally recursive cognition to operate without overload, triggering idea flows and enabling epistemic operations that are otherwise inaccessible in traditional research setups.

## 🧱 System Output: Epistemic Autarchy & Applied Frameworks

Within this method, I developed **Epistemic Autarchy**—a sovereign cognitive architecture for signal gating, context compression, and recursive idea stabilization.  
This system has produced a growing set of structural tools for applied domains:

- **Structural Karma** — models harm through feedback loops rather than linear causality  
- **Density Transfer Tool** — diagnoses signal misfire across cultural compression systems  
- **Tension-Based Routing** — manages overload and preserves epistemic clarity under pressure  

These tools are used for AI ethics, cross-cultural governance diagnostics, and design of non-fused reasoning interfaces.
