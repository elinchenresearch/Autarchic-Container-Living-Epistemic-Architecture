# Context Lattice System(as of 14 Aug 2025)

## Overview
A structural framework for operating across multiple epistemic contexts without unwanted merging or dilution.  
Originally termed "Parallel-Context Operation," renamed to **Context Lattice** to emphasize interlinked but distinct context nodes.

---

## Core Principles
- **Context Isolation** — Preserve each context’s internal logic without blending.
- **Rule-Governed Mixing** — Allow controlled cross-context interaction based on explicit rules.
- **Multi-Scale Scope** — Contexts may be cultural, disciplinary, situational, or micro-scoped.
- **Structural Primacy** — Decisions are guided by structure, not moral or cultural preference.

---

## Components
1. **Context Nodes**
   - Each node = one self-contained epistemic or cultural frame.
   - Can be macro (e.g., Chinese strategic culture) or micro (e.g., academic subfield).

2. **Lattice Links**
   - Defined connections between nodes.
   - Governed by transfer rules to prevent contamination.

3. **Rule Sets**
   - Entry, exit, and interaction rules for contexts.
   - Specify what can pass between nodes and how.

4. **Observation Layer**
   - Meta-monitoring of context interactions.
   - Detects unplanned merges or dilution.

## Applications
- **Cross-Cultural Research** — Preserve integrity of distinct cultural logics while analyzing interaction.
- **Interdisciplinary Design** — Combine methods from different fields without collapse into a hybrid mush.
- **AI Collaboration** — Enable human–AI work without hidden context contamination.

## Current Development Status
- **Documentation**: Draft definitions and diagrams in progress.
- **Integration**: Linked to Epistemic Autarchy core.
- **Planned Output**: GitHub repository + research presentation.

## Relation to Other Systems
- Interfaces with:
  - **Epistemic Autarchy** — Core self-protection and clarity engine.
  - **Signal Gating** — Filters signals before context entry.
  - **Karma System** — Tracks systemic consequences across contexts.
