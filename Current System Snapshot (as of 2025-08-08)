# Current System Snapshot (as of 2025-08-08)

## Name
Autarchic Container · Living Epistemic Architecture

## Purpose
A self-regulating cognitive architecture for maintaining clarity, routing signals, and preventing epistemic distortion.  
Designed to evolve through internal logic shifts, not external deadlines or truth claims.

## Core Components
1. **Epistemic Autarchy System** — root logic and self-processing mechanism
2. **Signal Gating** — input control and interpretation system
3. **Structural Karma Framework** — feedback and loop-tracking across natural, structural, and moral layers
4. **Density Transfer Tool** — cultural compression diagnostic
5. **Theorein · 流动定理系统** — non-static logic recognition while in motion

## Principles
- Structural integrity > completeness
- Internal coherence > external persuasion
- Change is normal; stability is selective

## Current State
- Core modules defined and named
- GitHub structure established as feedback mirror
- Visual mapping in progress
