# Index — Context Lattice System

This index provides a structured overview of the **Context Lattice System (CLS)** in book-style form.  
Each section can be expanded into standalone markdown files inside the repository.

---

## Part I — Foundations
1. **Why Context Matters**  
   - The problem of contamination in knowledge transfer  
   - Historical attempts at cross-context understanding (philosophy, anthropology, systems theory)  
   - Why a new discipline is needed  

2. **Defining the Context Lattice**  
   - What is a context?  
   - Lattice as metaphor vs lattice as formal structure  
   - Principles: Integrity, Bridging, Granularity, Feedback  

3. **Origins of the System**  
   - From Autarchic-Container-Living-Epistemic-Architecture to Context Lattice  
   - Key insights (signal gating, long memory horizon, parallel operation)  
   - Why CLS stands independently

## Part II — Architecture
4. **Core Components**  
   - Inside, Partial, Outside layers  
   - Node isolation  
   - Entry and exit points  

5. **Lattice Mechanics**  
   - Rule-based bridging protocols  
   - Structural fidelity testing  
   - Integrity feedback loops  

6. **Mapping Contexts**  
   - Macro-contexts (civilizational, cultural)  
   - Micro-contexts (organizational, situational)  
   - Nested and overlapping lattices

## Part III — Methodology
7. **Operational Methods**  
   - Lattice mapping workflow  
   - Boundary testing  
   - Rule definition and adaptation  

8. **Tools and Modules**  
   - Structural Karma  
   - Parallel-Context Operation  
   - Episodic and Long-horizon gating  

9. **Validation Strategies**  
   - Dual-path validation (upstream frameworks, downstream tools)  
   - Case-driven testing  
   - Metrics for structural fidelity  

---

## Part IV — Applications
10. **Cross-Cultural Operations**  
    - East/West epistemic interaction  
    - Avoiding ideological contamination  
    - Practical collaboration frameworks  

11. **Knowledge Systems and Academia**  
    - Relation to philosophy, systems theory, cognitive science, STS  
    - Filling the “missing science of context” gap  
    - How to integrate with research institutions  

12. **Technology and AI**  
    - Designing AI that respects epistemic boundaries  
    - Human–AI co-lattices  
    - Governance and alignment implications  

13. **Governance and Society**  
    - Context-aware policy design  
    - Negotiation across hostile/unequal contexts  
    - Rebuilding trust via context integrity

## Part V — Future Directions
14. **Context as a New Epistemic Unit**  
    - Rethinking truth, knowledge, and systems through context integrity  
    - CLS as a foundation for new disciplines  

15. **Community and Development**  
    - How CLS can grow into a research field  
    - Open-source development on GitHub  
    - Building a collaborative lattice
