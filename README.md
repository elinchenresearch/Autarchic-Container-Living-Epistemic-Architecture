# Elin Chen ‚Äî Systems for Epistemic Integrity and Structural Governance

This repository contains original research frameworks, system models, and applied modules developed to support new directions in AI ethics, cultural cognition, and structural logic.

This work is not a discipline‚Äîit is a structural reconstruction toolkit.  
It is designed for those working at the boundary of epistemic failure, institutional drift, and cultural misrecognition.

## üß≠ What's in this Repository

### 00_Framework-Overview
The foundational architecture of this system:
- **Structural Karma System** ‚Äì layered responsibility beyond causal blame
- **Epistemic Autarchy Stack** ‚Äì sovereign cognition, signal gating, tension routing
- **Signal Gating System** ‚Äì non-emotional boundary logic
- **Tension Routing System** ‚Äì dynamic decision processing through internal logic

### 01_Core-Articles
Key research outputs that anchor the system in cultural, ethical, and technological contexts.

### 02_Application Modules
Select designs applying structural logic to domains like AI architecture, emotional combinatorics, and post-crisis power realignment.

### 03_Reader Tools
Practical tools developed for others to engage with or test this system in live settings.

### 04_Public Access Docs
Simple entry points and pitch artifacts for institutions, collaborators, and funders.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Reading Protocols

This system is:
- **Non-linear** ‚Äî Designed as a logic network, not a curriculum
- **Non-political** ‚Äî Not moral critique, but signal clarification
- **Not derivative** ‚Äî Avoid projecting familiar lineage (e.g. Foucault, Confucius, Heidegger)

## üõ°Ô∏è Use & Contact

This work is open to serious readers, collaborators, and institutions committed to structural clarity.

Please do not adapt without signal alignment.
