# Autarchic Container · Living Epistemic Architecture

This repository is a working space for a living cognitive system.  
The structure will change as ideas evolve — files may be reorganized, replaced, or removed.

## What this is
A self-regulating architecture for:
- Maintaining clarity under change
- Routing and filtering signals
- Linking multiple modules into one coherent system

## How to read this repository
- **Not final** — content is in motion
- **Structural first** — some files may be placeholders
- **Internal logic** — updates follow coherence shifts, not external timelines

## Main Sections
- **CURRENT-SYSTEM.md** — snapshot of the system at this point in time
- **full-stack/** — overview of all layers
- **principles-origins/** — foundational principles and origin chains
- **ai-interface/** — how the system works with AI
- **system-operation/** — rules and operating modes
- **modules-tools/** — individual frameworks and tools
- **feedback-risk/** — feedback loops, risk analysis, and error logs
- **progress-maps/** — visual structures

---
*This is a living system — change is part of its design.*
