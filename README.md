# Epistemic Autarchy

**Elin's Core Cognitive Architecture**

This repository contains the full structural logic system designed to operate without external epistemic dependency. It is a modular, sovereign cognitive framework built for routing signal, processing tension, and enabling non-fused structural clarity in high-complexity environments.

> It is not a theory.  
> It is not a belief system.  
> It is not written to persuade.  
> It is an operating system.

## ðŸ”· System Overview

This repository contains:

- `Epistemic-Autarchy/` â€“ The 6-layer architecture (self-engine to feedback)
- `Logic-Modules/` â€“ Tools like signal gating, structural karma, and tension routing
- `Field-Application/` â€“ Case frameworks 
- `Meta-Systems/` â€“ Protection logic: deflection registers, self-positioning maps

Each module is self-contained but structurally linked.

## ðŸ§­ How to Read This Repository

1. Start from `SYSTEM_OVERVIEW.md` (coming soon)
2. Follow links by level of fidelity â€” don't skim; this system is recursive.
3. If you're unfamiliar with modular cognition or non-fusion logic, begin with Substack (forthcoming).
