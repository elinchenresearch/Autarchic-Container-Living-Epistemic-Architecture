# Context Lattice System

A discipline for preserving and operating across multiple epistemic contexts without collapse.  

- Protects context integrity (no contamination).  
- Enables rule-based bridging across systems.  
- Opens collaboration without assimilation.

## Disclaimer

⚠️ This repository represents an **emerging discipline in development**.  
The Context Lattice System is not yet fully formalized — what you will find here are structured notes, frameworks, and prototypes of methods.  

The ambition is large: to establish **"context integrity"** as a new epistemic science.  
The materials here are building blocks toward that goal, not a finished body of work.  

💡 Feedback, critique, and collaboration are welcome at this stage.  
If you see ways to test, extend, or refine these ideas, please engage — this project is designed to grow through dialogue.
