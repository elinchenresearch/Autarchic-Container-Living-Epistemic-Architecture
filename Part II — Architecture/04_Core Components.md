# 04_Core Components (Draft / In Progress)

‚ö†Ô∏è This document is a working draft. It captures the **core components of the Context Lattice System (CLS)** as developed so far.  
Details are subject to refinement as the system matures.

---

## 1. Context Node
- The **basic unit** of CLS.  
- A context is not ‚Äúbackground‚Äù but a **sealed epistemic container**.  
- Each node carries:  
  - **Rules of inference** (how reasoning proceeds inside it)  
  - **Validation criteria** (what counts as true/legitimate)  
  - **Survival logic** (why it persists, how it holds together)  

---

## 2. Boundary / Sealing
- Prevents **contamination** or collapse between contexts.  
- Sealing makes a context distinct and stable before interaction.  
- Without sealing, reasoning risks dissolving (e.g., universalism overwriting processual logic, or political capture of cultural frames).  

---

## 3. Signal Gating
- Controls how **signals** move in/out of a context.  
- Types identified so far:  
  - **Episodic Gating**: short-term, event-based, reactive (e.g., quick responses).  
  - **Long-Horizon Gating**: maintains continuity across long memory or cultural reasoning horizons.  
- Gating enables tolerance of **positive and negative simultaneously**, by controlling what enters and when.  

---

## 4. Bridging (Integrity-Preserving Movement)
- Movement across contexts requires **bridges**, not leaks.  
- Bridging ‚â† translation. Instead:  
  - Aligns logics where possible.  
  - Declares **non-equivalences** openly where they exist.  
- Preserves difference and prevents collapse into false universals.  

---

## 5. Context Density
- Some contexts carry more **implicit weight** than others (e.g., cultural density in Chinese reasoning).  
- Observed differences:  
  - Some are easier to ‚Äúhold‚Äù (e.g., condition-binding).  
  - Others are harder (e.g., long memory horizons).  
- Managing **context density** is essential to stability when contexts link.  

---

## 6. Upstream & Downstream Relation
- The architecture is **bi-directional**:  
  - **Upstream**: Core Theory & Operating Modes (why the lattice works).  
  - **Downstream**: Modules/Tools (e.g., Structural Karma, Signal Gating).  
- Ensures downstream tools remain grounded in upstream frameworks, and upstream frameworks can be validated by downstream applications.  

---

üìå **Summary**  
Core components identified so far:  
- Context Nodes  
- Sealing / Boundaries  
- Signal Gating  
- Bridging  
- Context Density  
- Upstream/Downstream Flow  

These elements define the **basic architecture** of CLS. They remain **in-progress**, to be elaborated further in *Lattice Mechanics* and *Mapping Contexts*.
