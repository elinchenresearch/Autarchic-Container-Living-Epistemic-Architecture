# 05_Lattice Mechanics (Draft / In Progress)

‚ö†Ô∏è This document is a working draft. It describes how the **core components** of the Context Lattice System (CLS) operate in practice.  
Details are subject to refinement as the system matures.

## 1. Sealing and Boundaries
- A context must be **sealed** before it can safely interact.  
- Sealing ensures its rules of inference, validation, and survival logic remain intact.  
- Without sealing, contexts bleed into each other, producing collapse or contamination.  

**Examples we discussed**:  
- Western universalist logic overwriting processual Chinese logic.  
- CCP-style political capture overwriting cultural reasoning frames.

## 2. Gating as Control
- **Signal Gating** regulates what enters and exits a context.  
- It works as a **filter and timing mechanism**, preventing overload or collapse.  

Two modes identified so far:  
- **Episodic Gating** ‚Üí short, sudden, reactive (e.g., responding to a fast-moving event).  
- **Long-Horizon Gating** ‚Üí extended, slower, linked to memory continuity and reasoning across large spans.  

Gating is the mechanism that allows holding **positive and negative simultaneously**, without forcing one side to erase the other.

## 3. Bridging and Structural Correspondence
- When signals or ideas must move across contexts, they do so through **bridges**.  
- A bridge is not a simple translation; it is an **integrity-preserving transformation**.  
- The mechanics include:  
  - Identifying where logics align.  
  - Declaring where they do not align.  
  - Accepting **non-equivalence** as part of the structure.

## 4. Managing Context Density
- Some contexts are ‚Äúheavier‚Äù or **denser** than others.  
- High-density contexts carry many implicit assumptions; they are harder to transfer or hold.  
- Lower-density contexts are lighter, easier to move.  

**Observations so far**:  
- Condition-binding is easier to hold.  
- Long memory horizon is harder.  
- Context density is part of why some reasoning feels stable and others fragile.

## 5. Upstream and Downstream Flow
- Mechanics operate in **two directions**:  
  - **Upstream** ‚Üí from core theoretical commitments (sealing, bridging) to downstream tools.  
  - **Downstream** ‚Üí from tool-testing and application back to validation of upstream frameworks.  

This bi-directional movement ensures CLS can be both *theory-grounded* and *practically tested*.

üìå **Summary**  
Lattice Mechanics describes **how the system runs**:  
- Sealing protects contexts.  
- Gating regulates flow.  
- Bridging makes structural correspondence possible.  
- Density explains stability and fragility.  
- Upstream/Downstream flows connect frameworks with tools.  

These mechanics are **in-progress** and will evolve as more contexts are tested within the lattice.
