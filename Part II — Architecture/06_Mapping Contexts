# 06_Mapping Contexts (Draft / In Progress)

‚ö†Ô∏è This document is a working draft. It describes how **contexts are aligned and compared** inside the Context Lattice System (CLS).  
Details are subject to refinement as the system matures.

## 1. Why Mapping Matters
- Sealed contexts cannot be assumed to ‚Äúnaturally‚Äù align.  
- To work across them, we need explicit **maps** that show:  
  - Where logics overlap.  
  - Where they diverge.  
  - Where they cannot be reconciled.  
- Mapping ensures that interaction happens with **integrity**, not collapse.

## 2. Types of Mapping
So far, several mapping approaches have been observed:

- **Direct Correspondence**  
  When two contexts share structurally similar rules or validation criteria.  
  *Example*: ‚Äúconditional binding‚Äù in Chinese reasoning ‚Üî ‚Äúif‚Äìthen logic‚Äù in Western reasoning.

- **Analogical Mapping**  
  When structures are not identical but relationally comparable.  
  *Example*: karma logic (structural balance of actions) ‚Üî systemic feedback in scientific models.

- **Declared Non-Equivalence**  
  When no safe mapping exists. Instead of forcing alignment, the system explicitly records ‚Äúno map.‚Äù  
  *Example*: Western individualist ‚Äúself‚Äù vs. Chinese relational ‚Äúself.‚Äù

## 3. Tools for Mapping
- **Context Density Check**  
  High-density contexts require more careful mapping; low-density ones are easier to align.  

- **Gates vs. Bridges**  
  - Gates let signals through without mapping (simple referencing).  
  - Bridges require a mapping table (structural correspondence).  

- **Upstream / Downstream Test**  
  - Test whether the mapping holds under **framework-level rules** (upstream).  
  - Test whether it works in **tools/applications** (downstream).  

---

## 4. Scales of Mapping
- **Macro Mapping**  
  *Between large cultural logics* (e.g., Chinese ‚Üî Western).  

- **Meso Mapping**  
  *Between disciplines or institutions* (e.g., physics ‚Üî anthropology).  

- **Micro Mapping**  
  *Within a single person or setting* (e.g., analytic mode ‚Üî holistic mode).  

Each scale requires different density management and different tolerance for non-equivalence.  

---

## 5. Failure Modes in Mapping
- **Over-Translation**  
  Forcing equivalence where there is none.  
- **Under-Mapping**  
  Treating two logics as unrelated when a partial bridge is possible.  
- **Silent Collapse**  
  Importing one context‚Äôs rules without declaring it.  

CLS uses **declared non-equivalence** to avoid these failures.  

---

## 6. Why Mapping Is Not Translation
- Translation assumes a shared background or universal grammar.  
- CLS assumes **no universal container**.  
- Mapping instead means making **explicit structural correspondences**, including where they fail.  

---

üìå **Summary**  
Mapping Contexts defines how nodes in the lattice are related:  
- Through direct correspondence, analogy, or declared non-equivalence.  
- With tools like density checks, gates/bridges, and upstream/downstream testing.  
- Across macro, meso, and micro scales.  

This approach ensures contexts interact **without collapse**, preserving their structural integrity.
