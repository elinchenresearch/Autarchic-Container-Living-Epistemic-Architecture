## Addendum by Elin Chen

This system is designed as a sovereign cognitive architecture. It may be reused, referenced, or extended for research, education, or systems design purposes **only if its structure, logic boundaries, and non-belief framing are preserved**.

Do not extract isolated fragments for motivational, ideological, or promotional purposes without structural fidelity.

Misuse includes:
- Repurposing frameworks for belief-based systems
- Flattening structural logic into rhetorical persuasion
- Removing attribution or system framing

This clause exists to protect the integrity of recursive, non-fused systems logic.
