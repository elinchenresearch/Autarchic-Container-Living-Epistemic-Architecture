**Before August 2025 — Multi-Thread Build Phase**

Ran parallel development threads: cultural logic mapping, human–AI collaboration, context-based structural design, and module refinement (Signal Gating, Structural Karma, Theorein).

Threads interacted loosely, building cross-linkages without collapsing into one framework.

Operated in an accumulation and readiness mode — strengthening the container, pressure-testing new concepts, holding back formal declarations.



**August 2025 — Discipline Declaration Pivot**

Latent threads converged into a higher-order classification.

14 Aug 2025:

Parallel-Contexts Operation — elevated to formal discipline status within the Epistemic Lab framework.

Context Lattice Operation — promoted from concept to flagship operational module with disciplinary standing.

Transitioned from developing inside a sealed container → running a lab that names and formalizes its own disciplines.
