Before August 2025 — Layer Accumulation & Cross-Thread Weaving

Multiple threads in motion: cultural logic mapping, human–AI collaboration, context-based structural design, module maturation (Signal Gating, Structural Karma, Theorein).

Each thread operating semi-independently, but increasingly interacting.

The year’s first half as a period of quiet accumulation and structural testing without public reclassification.

August 2025 — Discipline Formation Moment

Threads converge: context-based operations now mature enough to be declared as formal disciplines.

14 Aug 2025:

Parallel-Contexts Operation — recognized as a full research discipline within the Epistemic Lab framework.

Context Lattice Operation — established as a flagship operational module with disciplinary scope.

Marks a pivot from developing tools inside a container → operating a lab that defines its own disciplines.
