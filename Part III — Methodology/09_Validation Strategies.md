# 09_Validation Strategies (Draft / In Progress)

‚ö†Ô∏è Draft. This file explains how CLS can be **tested and validated**.  
Validation is bi-directional: from frameworks down to tools, and from tools back up to frameworks.

---

## 1. Dual-Path Validation
- **Upstream validation**: test whether core principles (sealing, gating, bridging) hold under scrutiny.  
- **Downstream validation**: test whether modules (signal gating, structural karma) *work in practice*.  

---

## 2. Integrity Tests
- Does sealing actually prevent contamination?  
- Can bridging preserve meaning while showing non-equivalence?  
- Is density management effective?

---

## 3. Tool Effectiveness
- Are downstream tools useful to researchers or practitioners?  
- Example: can structural karma provide new insights into systemic balance?  
- If tools prove effective, they indirectly confirm upstream logic.

---

## 4. Cross-Context Testing
- Apply CLS across **different scales**:  
  - Macro (culture)  
  - Meso (disciplines)  
  - Micro (cognitive modes)  
- See if the same methods remain valid.

---

üìå **Summary**  
Validation is not one-way.  
- **Frameworks** must stand under test.  
- **Tools** must work in practice.  
- Success in either direction reinforces the other.
