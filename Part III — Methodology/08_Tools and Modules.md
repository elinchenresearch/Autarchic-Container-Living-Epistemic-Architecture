# 08_Tools and Modules (Draft / In Progress)

‚ö†Ô∏è Draft. This file lists **downstream instruments** that emerge from CLS.  
They are not separate theories but **applications of the upstream framework**.

---

## 1. Signal Gating
- Already tested in thought experiments.  
- Provides a model for how to **control entry/exit of information** across contexts.

---

## 2. Structural Karma
- A downstream module that tracks **balance of actions across contexts**.  
- Works like a structural logic for positive/negative toleration.  
- Bridges to systemic feedback models in science.

---

## 3. Condition-Binding
- Easier to ‚Äúhold‚Äù than long memory horizon.  
- Can be formalized as a tool for **binding reasoning under given conditions**.  

---

## 4. Long Memory Horizon
- Harder to maintain but central to your work.  
- Functions as a module for **carrying reasoning across extended time spans**.

---

üìå **Summary**  
Modules are **instantiations** of CLS principles.  
They allow others to test and apply the framework in **concrete scenarios**.
