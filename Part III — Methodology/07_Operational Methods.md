# 07_Operational Methods (Draft / In Progress)

⚠️ Draft. This file captures the *practical moves* for working with the Context Lattice System (CLS).

---

## 1. Sealing
- First operation before interaction.  
- Declare what is “inside” and “outside.”  
- Prevents collapse or contamination.

---

## 2. Gating
- Controls what enters or exits a context.  
- Modes: Episodic (short-term) and Long-Horizon (extended continuity).  
- Used to manage **tolerance of contradiction** and regulate context density.

---

## 3. Bridging
- Used when signals must move across contexts.  
- Requires explicit structural mapping.  
- Preserves integrity by **declaring non-equivalence** where needed.

---

## 4. Density Management
- Adjusting for the “weight” of a context.  
- Lighter contexts are easier to transfer; denser ones require stronger sealing and stricter gates.  

---

## 5. Bi-Directional Flow
- Move from upstream frameworks → downstream tools.  
- Move from downstream tests → back to upstream frameworks.  
- Ensures theory and practice reinforce each other.

---

📌 **Summary**  
Operational methods are the repeatable *moves* that let CLS function without collapse: sealing, gating, bridging, density management, and bi-directional flow.
