# Overview

The **Context Lattice System (CLS)** is a framework for preserving and operating across multiple contexts without collapse. It treats **context itself** as the primary epistemic unit â€” not as background, but as the architecture that enables reasoning, knowledge, and exchange.

## Multi-Scale Approach

Contexts exist at different scales. CLS provides a way to map, preserve, and bridge them without reducing one into another:

- **Macro-contexts** â†’ large cultural-epistemic systems (e.g., Chinese vs. Western reasoning traditions).  
- **Meso-contexts** â†’ institutional or disciplinary settings (e.g., physics vs. anthropology, academic research vs. policy).  
- **Micro-contexts** â†’ situational or cognitive states within individuals (e.g., shifting between analytical and holistic reasoning modes, or moving from personal intuition to formal logic).

## Why This Matters

1. **At the macro level**, ignoring context leads to distortion and **contextual hegemony** â€” e.g., cultural universals that erase differences or political systems that monopolize meaning.  
2. **At the meso level**, interdisciplinary research collapses when one field forces its methods onto another without preserving integrity.  
3. **At the micro level**, individuals who straddle multiple modes of reasoning experience fragmentation unless they stabilize contexts into a coherent system.

## The Current Focus

While CLS is designed to apply across all scales, its **current foundation** is built from the dual analysis of **Chinese and Western epistemic traditions**.

- These two systems provide radically different logics of reasoning:  
  - Chinese traditions emphasize process, relation, and embeddedness.  
  - Western traditions emphasize categorization, abstraction, and universality.  

- This dual analysis is not the limit of CLS but a **test case** â€” demonstrating how contexts can remain intact yet interact without collapse.

## Toward a Discipline

By treating context as an epistemic unit:

- Philosophy avoids false universals.  
- Science resists blind misapplication of models.  
- Cultural studies gain a structural method beyond relativism.  
- Cognitive science expands to include context-shifting as a core process.  

CLS is therefore not only a method but the foundation of a **new discipline of context integrity**.

## Origin of the System
The Context Lattice System was first developed from the lived necessity of navigating between Chinese and Western epistemic traditions.  
This dual-context experience revealed that **context is not background but an active engine of reasoning**.  
While its origin is situated in this specific condition, the system generalizes into a discipline applicable across cultural, institutional, and cognitive contexts.
